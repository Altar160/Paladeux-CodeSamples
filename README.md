# Vampire Survivors Like - Corruption System (Unity C#) - Code Samples

Jam project (3 days). Solo programmer.

## Key systems
- Corruption cycle: player loses control periodically (auto-move + aura)
- Dual XP routing: kills give Pure XP or Corrupt XP depending on state
- Corrupt upgrades: automatic random upgrades every X levels + queued toast UI
- Victory condition: ending depends on which track has the higher level at timer end

## Files to review
- PortfolioCode/PlayerCorruption.cs
- PortfolioCode/XPDropOnDeath.cs
- PortfolioCode/AutoCorruptUpgradeManagerQueued.cs
- PortfolioCode/CountdownToVictory.cs
